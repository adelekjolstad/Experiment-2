# DAT250 Experiment 4

## Technical problems 
I encountered issues with the User entity because it initially did not have a numeric Id, which caused several exceptions. I resolved this by adding a numeric id with field @GeneratedValue. 

I also ran into problems with OneToMany and ManyToOne relationsships that were not correctly mapped. After reviewing the entity mappings and the corresponding mappedby attributes, I was able to identify the inconsistencies and fix them.
