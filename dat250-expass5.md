# DAT250 Experiment 5

## Technical problems 
I had problems downloading and running MongoDB, but updating to the lates version solved it. 

I also had some type colflicts wth IDs, so I changed all IDs to String. 

I encountered some error messages when trying to log wether data was retrived form the cache or the database. After fixing these errors, it worked as expected, and i could see that data was retrived from the cache when available.
